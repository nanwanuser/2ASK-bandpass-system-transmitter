# 2ASK-bandpass-system-transmitter
The project designed A 2ASK transmitter. The image signal was converted into a binary code stream by using MATLAB, and the pseudo-random code was obtained after scrambling with the m sequence. After cosine forming, it was modulated with the carrier signal inside the FPGA in 2ASK, and then the modulated 2ASK signal was output through D/A
