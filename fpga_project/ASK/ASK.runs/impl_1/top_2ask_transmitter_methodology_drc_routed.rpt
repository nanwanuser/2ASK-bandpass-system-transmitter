2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -4.146 ns between u_dac_controller/dac_cs_n_reg/C (clocked by sys_clk) and dac_cs_n (clocked by sys_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -4.306 ns between u_dac_controller/dac_wr1_n_reg/C (clocked by sys_clk) and dac_wr1_n (clocked by sys_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -9.161 ns between u_dac_controller/dac_data_reg[0]/C (clocked by sys_clk) and dac_data[0] (clocked by sys_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -9.165 ns between u_dac_controller/dac_data_reg[1]/C (clocked by sys_clk) and dac_data[1] (clocked by sys_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#5 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -9.171 ns between u_dac_controller/dac_data_reg[2]/C (clocked by sys_clk) and dac_data[2] (clocked by sys_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#6 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -9.172 ns between u_dac_controller/dac_data_reg[3]/C (clocked by sys_clk) and dac_data[3] (clocked by sys_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#7 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -9.172 ns between u_dac_controller/dac_data_reg[6]/C (clocked by sys_clk) and dac_data[6] (clocked by sys_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#8 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -9.174 ns between u_dac_controller/dac_data_reg[4]/C (clocked by sys_clk) and dac_data[4] (clocked by sys_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#9 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -9.175 ns between u_dac_controller/dac_data_reg[5]/C (clocked by sys_clk) and dac_data[5] (clocked by sys_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#10 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -9.179 ns between u_dac_controller/dac_data_reg[7]/C (clocked by sys_clk) and dac_data[7] (clocked by sys_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
