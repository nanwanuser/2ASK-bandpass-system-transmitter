2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.709 ns between u_dac_controller/dac_cs_n_reg/C (clocked by sys_clk) and dac_cs_n (clocked by sys_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.722 ns between u_dac_controller/dac_ile_reg/C (clocked by sys_clk) and dac_ile (clocked by sys_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.728 ns between u_dac_controller/dac_data_reg[1]/C (clocked by sys_clk) and dac_data[1] (clocked by sys_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.742 ns between u_dac_controller/dac_data_reg[7]/C (clocked by sys_clk) and dac_data[7] (clocked by sys_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#5 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.743 ns between u_dac_controller/dac_wr2_n_reg/C (clocked by sys_clk) and dac_xfer_n (clocked by sys_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#7 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.796 ns between u_dac_controller/dac_data_reg[2]/C (clocked by sys_clk) and dac_data[2] (clocked by sys_clk).
