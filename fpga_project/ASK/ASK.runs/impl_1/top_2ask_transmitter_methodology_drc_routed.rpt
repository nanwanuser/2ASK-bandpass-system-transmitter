2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -10.202 ns between p2_db_reg[5]/C (clocked by sys_clk) and p2_db[5] (clocked by sys_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -10.204 ns between p2_db_reg[4]/C (clocked by sys_clk) and p2_db[4] (clocked by sys_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -10.206 ns between p2_db_reg[0]/C (clocked by sys_clk) and p2_db[0] (clocked by sys_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -10.207 ns between p2_db_reg[1]/C (clocked by sys_clk) and p2_db[1] (clocked by sys_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#5 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -10.213 ns between p2_db_reg[7]/C (clocked by sys_clk) and p2_db[7] (clocked by sys_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#6 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -10.216 ns between p2_db_reg[6]/C (clocked by sys_clk) and p2_db[6] (clocked by sys_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#7 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -10.218 ns between p2_db_reg[2]/C (clocked by sys_clk) and p2_db[2] (clocked by sys_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#8 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -10.219 ns between p2_db_reg[12]/C (clocked by sys_clk) and p2_db[12] (clocked by sys_clk).

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#9 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -10.226 ns between p2_db_reg[11]/C (clocked by sys_clk) and p2_db[11] (clocked by sys_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#10 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -10.227 ns between p2_db_reg[3]/C (clocked by sys_clk) and p2_db[3] (clocked by sys_clk).
